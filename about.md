I have a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence (AI) from 
[Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/humanities-and-sciences/department-data-science-knowledge-engineering).
I am interested in research in various domains of AI. In my spare time, I also like to be busy with games; not only playing them, but also watching games (eSports) and
even developing games. For more info on me, and ways to contact me, please see the links at the bottom of this page.
