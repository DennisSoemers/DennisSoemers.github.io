  The [Digital Ludeme Project](http://www.ludeme.eu/) is an [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/)-funded project that I am working on 
  as PhD student under the supervision of [Dr. Cameron Browne](http://cambolbro.com/) at Maastricht University's 
  [Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/science-and-engineering/fse-departments/department-data-science-and-knowledge).
  
  **Summary from project page:** *"This project is a computational study of the world's traditional strategy games throughout recorded human history. It aims to improve our understanding of 
  traditional games using modern AI techniques, to chart their historical development and explore their role in the development of human culture and the spread 
  of mathematical ideas."*

My personal focus is on AI techniques, including search and learning algorithms, within the context of the project.
