C-Cure (Cost-Sensitive Dynamic User Authentication With Reinforcement Learning) is a research project that is funded by INNOVIRIS. Multiple groups from multiple universities are involved.
I am working on this project as a member of the [VUB AI Lab](https://ai.vub.ac.be/). More information about the project can be found on its [website](http://www.securit-brussels.be/project/c-cure/).

Publicly visible output of this project that I have directly and substantially contributed to:

- [Feature engineering code](https://github.com/lmzintgraf/MultiMAuS/tree/master/data/features) for the [MultiMAuS simulator](https://github.com/lmzintgraf/MultiMAuS) (which was itself primarily
developed by Luisa Zintgraf).
- Dennis J.N.J. Soemers, Tim Brys, Kurt Driessens, Mark H.M. Winands, and Ann Nowé (2018). “Adapting to Concept Drift in Credit Card Transaction Data Streams Using Contextual Bandits and Decision Trees”. 
In *Thirtieth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-18)*. Accepted.
