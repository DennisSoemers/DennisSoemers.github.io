  [C-Cure](http://www.securit-brussels.be/project/c-cure/): Cost-Sensitive Dynamic User Authentication With Reinforcement Learning is a research project funded by INNOVIRIS. I worked on
  this project from October 2016 till October 2018, affiliated with the [VUB AI Lab](https://ai.vub.ac.be/).
  
  My research within the project primarily involved Reinforcement Learning and Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms, in the context of user authentication problems.

C-Cure (Cost-Sensitive Dynamic User Authentication With Reinforcement Learning) is a research project that has been funded by INNOVIRIS. Multiple groups from multiple universities were involved.
I worked on this project as a member of the [VUB AI Lab](https://ai.vub.ac.be/). More information about the project can be found on its [website](http://www.securit-brussels.be/project/c-cure/).

Publicly visible output of this project that I have directly and substantially contributed to:

- [Feature engineering code](https://github.com/lmzintgraf/MultiMAuS/tree/master/data/features) for the [MultiMAuS simulator](https://github.com/lmzintgraf/MultiMAuS) (which was itself primarily
developed by Luisa Zintgraf).
- Dennis J.N.J. Soemers, Tim Brys, Kurt Driessens, Mark H.M. Winands, and Ann Now√© (2018).
