<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About</h3>

<p> I am a researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI); currently a PhD candidate at the 
<a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dacs">Department of Advanced Computing Sciences</a>
of Maastricht University.</p>

<p>I often very much enjoy self-learning how to use new tools, frameworks, and programming languages
relevant to my work as well as my hobbies. For example, I learned how to work with Java Native Interface
for my work on the <a href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/Polygames/tree/main/src/games/ludii">bridge between Ludii and Polygames</a></p>.

<p>Outside of AI research, I am also interested in programming languages (pros and cons of different languages), optimising software (reading things like
<a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf">“What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory”</a>), gaming, and esports.</p>

    <p>I am currently doing a PhD at the <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dacs">Department of Advanced Computing Sciences</a>
of Maastricht University, where I am working on the <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/">ERC</a>-funded <a href="http://www.ludeme.eu/">Digital Ludeme Project</a>.
In Fall 2020 I was a Research Intern at <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/">Facebook AI Research</a>.
Previously, I worked for two years on the <a href="http://www.securit-brussels.be/project/c-cure/">C-Cure</a> project as a PhD student at the 
<a href="https://ai.vub.ac.be/">Artificial Intelligence Lab</a> of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Before that, I got a B.Sc. in Kowledge Engineering and a M.Sc. in 
Artificial Intelligence, both from the <a href="http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dke">Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering</a>
of Maastricht University.</p>

<p>Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, my main research interests are in Reinforcement Learning, other variants of Machine Learning, and Search/Planning algorithms.</p>

<p>Outside of Artificial Intelligence research, I am also interested in programming languages (pros and cons of different languages), optimising software (reading things like
<a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf">“What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory”</a>), gaming, and esports.</p>
