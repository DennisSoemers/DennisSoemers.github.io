I am currently a PhD student at the [Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering](http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dke)
of Maastricht University, where I am working on the [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/)-funded [Digital Ludeme Project](http://www.ludeme.eu/).
Previously, I worked for two years on the [C-Cure](http://www.securit-brussels.be/project/c-cure/) project as a PhD student at the 
[Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://ai.vub.ac.be/) of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Before that, I got a B.Sc. in Kowledge Engineering and a M.Sc. in 
Artificial Intelligence, both from the [Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering](http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/dke)
of Maastricht University.

Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, my main research interests are in Reinforcement Learning, other variants of Machine Learning, and Search/Planning algorithms.

Outside of Artificial Intelligence research, I am also interested in programming languages (pros and cons of different languages), optimizing software (reading things like
["What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory"](https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf)), gaming, and esports.
