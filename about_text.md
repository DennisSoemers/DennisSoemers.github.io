I am currently a PhD student at the [Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://ai.vub.ac.be/) of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Before that, I got a B.Sc. in 
Kowledge Engineering and a M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence, both from the 
[Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/humanities-and-sciences/department-data-science-knowledge-engineering)
of Maastricht University.

Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, my main research interests are in Reinforcement Learning, other variants of Machine Learning, and Search/Planning algorithms.
